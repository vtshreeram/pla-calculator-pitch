## Sales Materials & Messaging

### 15-Minute Hospital Meeting Structure

**Pre-Meeting Prep (10 mins):**

- Frame as "making this relevant for you"

**Minutes 2-4: Problem Identification**
- Show their Google reviews OR do bed math WITH them
- "5 discharges × 4 hours × 30 days = 600 bed-hours blocked = ₹3.75L lost"

**Minutes 5-6: Amplify Pain**
- Stack multiple problems: bed revenue + billing delays + staff waste + complaints
- Get them to confirm each one

**Minutes 7: Transition**
- "This isn't YOUR problem, it's EVERY hospital's problem"
- Root cause: handwritten → manual process

**Minutes 8-10: Demo**
- Show before/after workflow
- Emphasize: 4 hours → 10 minutes
- Name-drop pilot hospital

**Minutes 11-12: Handle Objections**
- Accuracy: 90% (you review)
- Cost: ₹15k/month vs ₹17L saved
- Implementation: 3 days

**Minutes 13-14: Create Urgency**

## Quick Reference: Elevator Pitch

**30-Second Version:**

"Patient Lens AI digitizes handwritten discharge summaries in 10 minutes using AI. Hospitals lose ₹12.75 lakhs per month from the 4-hour gap between doctor clearance and patient discharge. We eliminate that gap. 10 hospitals live, zero churn, 90% accuracy. Patients get summaries on WhatsApp instantly. Hospitals save money, improve reviews, and free up staff. ₹100 per discharge, 100X ROI in month 1."

**60-Second Version:**

"I'm [Shreeram/Kirthi] from Patient Lens AI. We analyzed 200 Indian hospitals and found they're collectively losing ₹25.5 crores every month from a simple problem: discharge delays. 

A doctor writes 'discharge' at 11 AM. Patient waits until 3 PM for paperwork. The bed is blocked, billing is delayed, patient is frustrated.

We built an AI that reads doctor's handwriting and creates a digital discharge summary in 10 minutes—not 4 hours. 90% accuracy. Patient gets it on WhatsApp instantly. Billing gets it same day. Bed turns over immediately.

We're live in 10 hospitals, 50 onboarding. Zero churn. ₹100 per discharge summary. Average hospital saves ₹17 lakhs per month.

We launched 90 days ago and we're already at ₹15 lakh ARR. We're proving that Indian hospitals are ready for AI automation—starting with discharge, but ending as their full operating system."
